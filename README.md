The classes in current repository allow for statistical evaluation of Fat tails in financial time series. In particular, defines: 
- Visual Inspection of Paretianity
- Evaluation of the ratio between Maximum Value and the Sum
- Visualization for the absence of Kurtosis Convergence at different lags
- Bootstrap Estimation of the tail parameter 'alpha' for a standard Pareto Distribution.
